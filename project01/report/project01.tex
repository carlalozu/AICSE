\newline

The main objective of the project is to apply machine learning algorithms to solve various tasks
related to the preliminary design of a thermal energy storage.
The project is divided into four tasks, the solution of each of which is
described in detail below.

\section{Task 1:  PINNs for solving PDEs}

\section{Task 2: PDE-Constrained Inverse Problem}

\section{Task 3: Applied Regression}

\section{Task 4 - Robustness of PINNs and Transferability (Optional)}
